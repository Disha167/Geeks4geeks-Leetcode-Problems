//THIS IS A SIMPLE PROBLEM OF DP
//DIFFERENCE FROM COIN CHAGE IS:üßêüßê
//In coin change, we consider 1 2 1 , 1 1 2 and 2 1 1 all same,
//but here we have to count 3 for all the above cases seperately.
//Explainationüòãüòã
//For counting the number of hops for 4, we add all the possible hops
//for 3,2,1 we have 3 hops for 3, 2 hops for 2, 1 hop for 1, so for 4 there
//are 3+2+1 7 hops
//Similarly, if we take 5, see in recursion tree made below, for going through 4
//we can take either path from 3, from 2 , from 1 so 7 paths from going through
//4 and rest we can also make 5 by 3+2, and ways of reaching 3 is 4 so now
//number of ways reaching 5 becomes 7+4 i.e 11
//Now, we can still go to 5 by 2+3 and ways of reaching 2 is 2, so ways of
//reaching 5 finally becomes 11+2=13ans.
