//key to observation here is that 2 is the only prime number that is even and the two minimum prime nos. are 2, 3 so the minimum sum obtained by adding two prime nos. will be 5
//And, as in a+b=c, c will be a prime number so it has to be odd as if it will be even, it will becom divisible by 2.
//For, c to be odd, one of the a or b should be even and other should be odd. And, a and b also has to be prime so if we take a as the even number, then a has to be 2 as there are
//no other even prime no. So, the tuple becomes of the form(2,b,b+2)
//Now, we only have to check whether b and b+2 are prime nos.
