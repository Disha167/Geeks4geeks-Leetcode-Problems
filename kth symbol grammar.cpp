//Overview of hypothesis developed in kth symbol in grammar:
//The hypothesis of kth grammar function in designed such that the first half returns the same as N-1th row and second half in else condition gives the complement.
//Remember recursion work like magic ,you don't have to think how it works, just have good observation skills and compute only till the second last step.
//Eg:
//N=1 0
//N=2 0 1
//N=3 0 1 1 0
//N=4 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
